abstract = {Accurate estimation of responses of understory plants to disturbance is essential for understanding the efficacy of management activities. However, the ability to assess changes in the abundance of plants may be hampered by inappropriate sampling methodologies. Conventional methods for sampling understory plants may be precise for common species but may fail to adequately characterize abundance of less common species. We tested conventional (modified Whittaker plots and Daubenmire and point-line intercept transects) and novel (strip adaptive cluster sampling [SACS]) approaches to sampling understory plants to determine their efficacy for quantifying abundance on control and thinned-and-burned treatment units in Pinus ponderosa forests in western Montana, USA. For species grouped by growth-form and for common species, all three conventional designs were capable of estimating cover with a 50{\%} relative margin of error with reasonable sample sizes (3-36 replicates for growth-form groups; 8-14 replicates for common species); however, increasing precision to 25{\%} relative margin of error required sample sizes that may be infeasible (11-143 replicates for growth-form groups; 28-54 replicates for common species). All three conventional designs required enormous sample sizes to estimate cover of nonnative species as a group (29-60 replicates) and of individual less common species (62-118 replicates), even with a 50{\%} relative margin of error. SACS was the only design that efficiently sampled less common species, requiring only 6-11{\%} as many replicates relative to conventional designs. Conventional designs may not be effective for estimating abundance of the majority of forest understory plants, which are typically patchily distributed with low abundance, or of newly establishing nonnative plants. Novel methods such as SACS should be considered in investigations when cover of these species is of concern.},

@article{Acevedo-Whitehouse2009,
abstract = {Environmental change has negatively affected most biological systems on our planet and is becoming of increasing concern for the well-being and survival of many species. At an organism level, effects encompass not only endocrine disruptions, sex-ratio changes and decreased reproductive parameters, but also include teratogenic and genotoxic effects, immunosuppression and other immune-system impairments that can lead directly to disease or increase the risk of acquiring disease. Living organisms will strive to maintain health by recognizing and resolving abnormal situations, such as the presence of invading microorganisms or harmful peptides, abnormal cell replication and deleterious mutations. However, fast-paced environmental changes may pose additional pressure on immunocompetence and health maintenance, which may seriously impact population viability and persistence. Here, we outline the importance of a functional immune system for survival and examine the effects that exposure to a rapidly changing environment might exert on immunocompetence. We then address the various levels at which anthropogenic environmental change might affect wildlife health and identify potential deficits in reproductive parameters that might arise owing to new immune challenges in the context of a rapidly changing environment. Throughout the paper, a series of examples and case studies are used to illustrate the impact of environmental change on wildlife health.},

abstract = {This study was undertaken to apply the logistic model with nonlinear mixed effects to model growth in Japanese quail. Nonlinear mixed models (NLMM) allow for the inclusion of random factors in a linear manner, which accounts for the between-individual variability and heterogeneous variance. A fixed effects model (M1) was compared with NLMM containing either 1 (M2) or 2 (M3) random effects using the residual error variance, -2 log-likelihood, Akaike information criterion, and Bayesian information criterion as the criteria for evaluating these alternative models. In M2, the between-bird variability was modeled by varying the asymptotic BW, which led to a 57{\%} reduction in the residual variance compared with M1 in males. In M3, the between-bird variation was partitioned into variances due to varying asymptotic BW and the age at the inflection point. The residual variance in M3 was reduced by about 72 and 38{\%} compared with M1 and M2, respectively, in males. The correlation coefficient between the actual and predicted BW for M1, M2, and M3 were 0.9887, 0.9955, and 0.9975, respectively. Similar results were found in females. The model evaluation criteria indicated that the mixed effect models fitted the data better than the fixed effect model because they account for between-bird variation. The use of NLMM is recommended for modeling growth data in poultry because the predicted BW at different ages is more accurate than using the mean prediction function of the fixed effect model.},

abstract = {The high-dimensionality of many compositional data sets has caused geologists to look for insights into the observed patterns of variability through two dimension-reducing procedures: (i) the selection of a few subcompositions for particular study, and (ii) principal component analysis. After a brief critical review of the unsatisfactory state of current statistical methodology for these two procedures, this paper takes as a starting point for the resolution of persisting difficulties a recent approach to principal component analysis through a new definition of the covariance structure of a composition. This approach is first applied for expository purposes to a small illustrative compositional data set and then to a number of larger published geochemical data sets. The new approach then leads naturally to a method measuring the extent to which a subcomposition retains the pattern of variability of the whole composition and so provides a criterion for the selection of suitable subcompositions. Such a selection process is illustrated by application to geochemical data sets.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Maternal phenotype and maternal environment can profoundly affect the phenotype and fitness of offspring. Yet the causes of variation in such maternal effects are rarely known. Embryos in avian eggs cannot develop without being incubated and this creates an opportunity for maternal control of duration and onset of offspring development. However, females might adjust the start of incubation (e.g., coincident with the first egg or delayed until after egg-laying) in response to environmental conditions that they experience at the time of breeding. We studied two populations of the house finch ( Carpodacus mexicanus) that breed at the climatic extremes of the species' geographical range (Montana and Alabama) and found that in both populations, the timing of incubation onset was closely associated with the bias in the sequence in which male and female eggs were laid within a clutch. When females started incubation with the first egg, they produced sons and daughters in highly biased sequence, when females delayed the onset of incubation until after the egg-laying, the sequence of sons and daughters was not biased. Because in both populations, onset of incubation was associated with the ambient temperature, these results emphasize that maternal effects on offspring can be influenced by ecological conditions experienced by parental generation.},

Traditional groundwater models such as MODFLOW have been used to predict changes in regional groundwater levels, and thus riparian vegetation potential attributable to anthropogenic water use. This article describes an approach that improves on these modeling techniques through several innovations. First, evapotranspiration from riparian/wetland systems is modeled in a manner that more realistically reflects plant ecophysiology and vegetation complexity. In the authors' model programs (RIP-ET and PRE-RIP-ET), the single, monotonically increasing evapotranspiration flux curve in traditional groundwater models is replaced with a set of ecophysiologically based curves, one for each plant functional group present. For each group, the curve simulates transpiration declines that occur both as water levels decline below rooting depths and as waters rise to levels that produce anoxic soil conditions. Accuracy is further improved by more effective spatial handling of vegetation distribution, which allows modeling of surface elevation and depth to water for multiple vegetation types within each large model cell. The use of RIP-ET in groundwater models can improve the accuracy of basin scale estimates of riparian evapotranspiration rates, riparian vegetation water requirements, and water budgets. Two case studies are used to demonstrate that RIP-ET produces significantly different evapotranspiration estimates than the traditional method. When combined with vegetation mapping and a supporting program (RIP-GIS), RIP-ET also enables predictions of riparian vegetation response to water use and development scenarios. The RIP-GIS program links the head distribution from MODFLOW with surface digital elevation models, producing moderate- to high-resolution depth-to-groundwater maps. Together with information on plant rooting depths, these can be used to predict vegetation response to water allocation decisions. The different evapotranspiration outcomes produced by traditional and RIP-ET approaches affect resulting interpretations of hydro-vegetation dynamics, including the effects of groundwater pumping stress on existing habitats, and thus affect subsequent policy decisions.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The high-throughput sequencing technologies have provided a powerful tool to study the microbial organisms living in various environments. Characterizing microbial interactions can give us insights into how they live and work together as a community. Metagonomic data are usually summarized in a compositional fashion due to varying sampling/sequencing depths from one sample to another. We study the co-occurrence patterns of microbial organisms using their relative abundance information. Analyzing compositional data using conventional correlation methods has been shown prone to bias that leads to artifactual correlations.

RESULTS: We propose a novel method, regularized estimation of the basis covariance based on compositional data (REBACCA), to identify significant co-occurrence patterns by finding sparse solutions to a system with a deficient rank. To be specific, we construct the system using log ratios of count or proportion data and solve the system using the l1-norm shrinkage method. Our comprehensive simulation studies show that REBACCA (i) achieves higher accuracy in general than the existing methods when a sparse condition is satisfied; (ii) controls the false positives at a pre-specified level, while other methods fail in various cases and (iii) runs considerably faster than the existing comparable method. REBACCA is also applied to several real metagenomic datasets.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R codes for the proposed method are available at http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/∼hji403/REBACCA.htm

abstract = {Understanding how large herbivores shape plant diversity patterns is an important challenge in community ecology, especially because many ungulate populations in the northern hemisphere have recently expanded. Because species within plant communities can exhibit strong interactions (e.g., competition, facilitation), selective foraging by large herbivores is likely not only to affect the abundance of palatable species, but also to induce cascading effects across entire plant communities. To investigate these possibilities, we first tested the effects of deer browsing and soil disturbance on herbaceous plant diversity patterns in boreal forest, using standard analyses of variance. Second, we evaluated direct and indirect effects of deer browsing and soil disturbance on the small-scale richness of herbaceous taxa using a multilevel path analysis approach. The first set of analyses showed that deer browsing and soil disturbance influenced herb richness. Path analyses revealed that deer browsing and soil disturbance influenced richness via complex chains of interactions, involving dominant (i.e., the most abundant) browsing-tolerant (DBT) taxa and white birch (Betula papyrifera), a species highly preferred by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We found no evidence that an increase of white birch in fenced quadrats was the direct cause of a decrease in herb richness. However, we found strong evidence that a higher abundance of DBT taxa (i.e., graminoids and Circium arvense), both in fenced and unfenced quadrats, increased herb layer richness. We propose an empirical model in which competitive interactions between white birch and DBT taxa regulate the strength of facilitative relationships between the abundance of DBT taxa and herb richness. In this model, deer browsing and the intensity of soil disturbance initiate a complex chain of cascading effects in boreal plant communities by controlling the abundance of white birch.},

Quick response flow is predicted from a storage/contributing area relationship derived analytically from the topographic structure of a unit within a basin. Average soil water response is represented by a constant leakage infiltration store and an exponential subsurface water store. A simple non-linear routing procedure related to the link frequency distribution of the channel network completes the model and allows distinct basin sub-units, such as headwater and sideslope areas to be modelled separately. The model parameters are physically based in the sense that they may be determined directly by measurement and the model may be used at ungauged sites. Procedures for applying the model and tests with data from the Crimple Beck basin are described. Using only measured and est...},

abstract = {Models of habitat preference are widely used to quantify animal-habitat relationships, to describe and predict differential space use by animals, and to identify habitat that is important to an animal (i.e. that is assumed to influence fitness). Quantifying habitat preference involves the statistical comparison of samples of habitat use and availability. Preference is therefore contingent upon both of these samples. The inferences that can be made from use versus availability designs are influenced by subjectivity in defining what is available to the animal, the problem of quantifying the accessibility of available resources and the framework in which preference is modelled. Here, we describe these issues, document the conditional nature of preference and establish the limits of inferences that can be drawn from these analyses. We argue that preference is not interpretable as reflecting the intrinsic behavioural motivations of the animal, that estimates of preference are not directly comparable among different samples of availability and that preference is not necessarily correlated with the value of habitat to the animal. We also suggest that preference is context-dependent and that functional responses in preference resulting from changing availability are expected. We conclude by describing advances in analytical methods that begin to resolve these issues.},

We analyze an experiment addressing the relationship between omnivorous feeding linkages and community stability. Our goal is to determine whether communities with different predator compositions respond similarly to environmental disturbance. To evaluate these data, we develop a hierarchical statistical model that combines Aitchison's logistic normal distribution with a conditional multinomial observation distribution. In addition, we present an algebra for compositions that includes addition, scalar multiplication, and a metric for differences in compositions. The algebra aids interpretation of treatment effects, treatment interactions, and covariates. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used for inference in a Bayesian framework. Our experimental results indicate that a high degree of omnivory can help to stabilize community dynamics and prevent radical shifts in community composition. This result is at odds with classical food-web predictions, but agrees with recent theoretical formulations.},

abstract = {Transmission of bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) among wildlife and livestock has created important risks for conservation and agriculture. Management strategies aimed at controlling TB have typically been top-down, regionally focused, and government-led programs that were at best only partially successful. The purpose of this study was to quantify co-mingling of elk and white-tailed deer (WTD) with cattle at multiple spatial scales (i.e., the regional farm scale and winter cattle feeding area patch) in southwestern Manitoba, Canada, to assess the potential for bovine tuberculosis transmission and identify alternative management strategies. For each spatial scale we quantified use of cattle farms by elk and white-tailed deer. We mailed questionnaires to rural households and then conducted personal interviews with 86 cattle farmers to map the spatial distribution of their cattle winter feeding areas at a fine scale. We deployed Global Positioning System (GPS) collars on 48 wild elk and 16 wild white-tailed deer from 2003 to 2011. Elk were observed on farms by 66{\%} of cattle producers, including 5{\%} and 20{\%} who observed direct and indirect contact, respectively, between elk and cattle. Cattle producers consistently (≈100{\%}) observed white-tailed deer on their farms, including 11{\%} and 47{\%} whom observed direct and indirect contact, respectively, between white-tailed deer and cattle. A higher probability of white-tailed deer-cattle contact at the regional scale occurs on farms that (1) left crop residues specifically for wildlife, (2) had larger cattle herds, (3) used round bale feeders, and (4) were farther away from protected areas. None of the GPS-collared elk locations overlapped with cattle winter feeding areas. In contrast, 21{\%} of GPS-collared white-tailed deer locations overlapped with winter cattle winter feeding areas (22{\%} of these were from male WTD and 78{\%} were from female WTD). White-tailed deer selected cattle winter feeding areas with higher (1) forage crop, (2) grassland/rangeland, and (3) forest cover around the cattle feeding area. Farmers overall expressed strongly negative attitudes toward eradicating the elk population or fencing the park to eradicate TB, but were generally supportive of less invasive and farm-based approaches. Our results suggested that management efforts to prevent TB transmission at the wildlife-agriculture interface can be effectively implemented using a 'bottom-up' approach that focuses on practical, farm-based mitigation strategies. This approach can be implemented by individual farm operators, is relatively low cost, and is generally well supported by farmers relative to other more extreme and controversial measures like wildlife eradication.},

@article{Buler2007,
abstract = {Most of our understanding of habitat use by migrating land birds comes from studies conducted at single, small spatial scales, which may overemphasize the importance of intrinsic habitat factors, such as food availability, in shaping migrant distributions. We believe that a multi-scale approach is essential to assess the influence of factors that control en route habitat use. We determined the relative importance of eight variables, each operating at a habitat-patch, landscape, or regional spatial scale, in explaining the differential use of hardwood forests by Nearctic-Neotropical land birds during migration. We estimated bird densities through transect surveys at sites near the Mississippi coast during spring and autumn migration within landscapes with variable amounts of hardwood forest cover. At a regional scale, migrant density increased with proximity to the coast, which was of moderate importance in explaining bird densities, probably due to constraints imposed on migrants when negotiating the Gulf of Mexico. The amount of hardwood forest cover at a landscape scale was positively correlated with arthropod abundance and had the greatest importance in explaining densities of all migrants, as a group, during spring, and of insectivorous migrants during autumn. Among landscape scales ranging from 500 m to 10 km radius, the densities of migrants were, on average, most strongly and positively related to the amount of hardwood forest cover within a 5 km radius. We suggest that hardwood forest cover at this scale may be an indicator of habitat quality that migrants use as a cue when landing at the end of a migratory flight. At the patch scale, direct measures of arthropod abundance and plant community composition were also important in explaining migrant densities, whereas habitat structure was of little importance. The relative amount of fleshy-fruited trees was positively related and was the most important variable explaining frugivorous migrant density during autumn. Although constraints extrinsic to habitat had a moderate role in explaining migrant distributions, our results are consistent with the view that food availability is the ultimate factor shaping the distributions of birds during stopover.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer, are powerful new tools for investigating a wide range of biological and medical questions. Statistical and computational methods are key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data.

RESULTS: We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing platform that could impact the accuracy of results. They also reveal the need for further research in the development of statistical and computational methods for mRNA-Seq.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cost of DNA sequencing has undergone a dramatical reduction in the past decade. As a result, sequencing technologies have been increasingly applied to genomic research. RNA-Seq is becoming a common technique for surveying gene expression based on DNA sequencing. As it is not clear how increased sequencing capacity has affected measurement accuracy of mRNA, we sought to investigate that relationship.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULT: We empirically evaluate the accuracy of repeated gene expression measurements using RNA-Seq. We identify library preparation steps prior to DNA sequencing as the main source of error in this process. Studying three datasets, we show that the accuracy indeed improves with the sequencing depth. However, the rate of improvement as a function of sequence reads is generally slower than predicted by the binomial distribution. We therefore used the beta-binomial distribution to model the overdispersion. The overdispersion parameters we introduced depend explicitly on the number of reads so that the resulting statistical uncertainty is consistent with the empirical data that measurement accuracy increases with the sequencing depth. The overdispersion parameters were determined by maximizing the likelihood. We shown that our modified beta-binomial model had lower false discovery rate than the binomial or the pure beta-binomial models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We proposed a novel form of overdispersion guaranteeing that the accuracy improves with sequencing depth. We demonstrated that the new form provides a better fit to the data.},

abstract = {Differences in day length may act as a critical factor in bird biology by introducing time constraints in energy acquisition during winter. Thus, differences in day length might operate as a main determinant of bird abundance along latitudinal gradients. This work examines the influence of day length on the abundance of wintering crested tits (Lophophanes cristatus) in 26 localities of Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera) dwarf woodlands (average height of 5 m) located along a latitudinal gradient in the Spanish highlands, while controlling for the influence of food availability, minimum night temperature, habitat structure and landscape characteristics. Top regression models in the AIC framework explained 56{\%} of variance in bird numbers. All models incorporated day length as the variable with the highest magnitude effect. Food availability also played an important role, although only the crop of ripe juniper fruits, but not arthropods, positively affected crested tit abundance. Differences in vegetation structure across localities had also a strong positive effect (average tree height and juniper tree density). Geographical variation in night temperature had no influence on crested tit distribution, despite the low winter temperatures reached in these dwarf forests. This paper demonstrates for the first time that winter bird abundance increases with day length after controlling for the effect of other environmental variables. Winter average difference in day length was only 10.5 minutes per day along the 1°47' latitudinal interval (190 km) included in this study. This amount of time, which reaches 13.5 h accumulated throughout the winter season, appears to be large enough to affect the long-term energy budget of small passerines during winter and to shape the distribution of winter bird abundance under restrictive environmental conditions.},

@article{Cohen2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of high-risk malaria foci can help enhance surveillance or control activities in regions where they are most needed. Associations between malaria risk and land-use/land-cover are well-recognized, but these environmental characteristics are closely interrelated with the land's topography (e.g., hills, valleys, elevation), which also influences malaria risk strongly. Parsing the individual contributions of land-cover/land-use variables to malaria risk requires examining these associations in the context of their topographic landscape. This study examined whether environmental factors like land-cover, land-use, and urban density improved malaria risk prediction based solely on the topographically-determined context, as measured by the topographic wetness index.

METHODS: The topographic wetness index, an estimate of predicted water accumulation in a defined area, was generated from a digital terrain model of the landscape surrounding households in two neighbouring western Kenyan highland communities. Variables determined to best encompass the variance in this topographic wetness surface were calculated at a household level. Land-cover/land-use information was extracted from a high-resolution satellite image using an object-based classification method. Topographic and land-cover variables were used individually and in combination to predict household-level malaria in the communities through an iterative split-sample model fitting and testing procedure. Models with only topographic variables were compared to those with additional predictive factors related to land-cover/land-use to investigate whether these environmental factors improved prediction of malaria based on the shape of the land alone.

RESULTS: Variables related to topographic wetness proved most useful in predicting the households of individuals contracting malaria in this region of rugged terrain. Other variables related to human modification of the environment also demonstrated clear associations with household malaria. However, these land-cover/land-use variables failed to produce unambiguous improvements in statistical predictive models controlling for important topographic factors, with none improving prediction of household-level malaria more than 75{\%} of the time.

CONCLUSIONS: Topographic wetness values in this region of highly varied terrain more accurately predicted houses at greater risk of malaria than did consideration of land-cover/land-use characteristics. As such, those planning control or local elimination strategies in similar highland regions may use topographic and geographic characteristics to effectively identify high-receptivity regions that may require enhanced vigilance.},

@article{Cohen2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transmission of Plasmodium falciparum generally decreases with increasing elevation, in part because lower temperature slows the development of both parasites and mosquitoes. However, other aspects of the terrain, such as the shape of the land, may affect habitat suitability for Anopheles breeding and thus risk of malaria transmission. Understanding these local topographic effects may permit prediction of regions at high risk of malaria within the highlands at small spatial scales.

METHODS: Hydrologic modelling techniques were adapted to predict the flow of water across the landscape surrounding households in two communities in the western Kenyan highlands. These surface analyses were used to generate indices describing predicted water accumulation in regions surrounding the study area. Households with and without malaria were compared for their proximity to regions of high and low predicted wetness. Predicted wetness and elevation variables were entered into bivariate and multivariate regression models to examine whether significant associations with malaria were observable at small spatial scales.

RESULTS: On average, malaria case households (n = 423) were located 280 m closer to regions with very high wetness indices than non-malaria "control" households (n = 895) (t = 10.35, p < 0.0001). Distance to high wetness indices remained an independent predictor of risk after controlling for household elevation in multivariate regression (OR = 0.93 [95{\%} confidence interval = 0.89-0.96] for a 100 m increase in distance). For every 10 m increase in household elevation, there was a 12{\%} decrease in the odds of the house having a malaria case (OR = 0.88 [0.85-0.90]). However, after controlling for distance to regions of high predicted wetness and the community in which the house was located, this reduction in malaria risk was not statistically significant (OR = 0.98 [0.94-1.03]).

CONCLUSION: Proximity to terrain with high predicted water accumulation was significantly and consistently associated with increased household-level malaria incidence, even at small spatial scales with little variation in elevation variables. These results suggest that high wetness indices are not merely proxies for valley bottoms, and hydrologic flow models may prove valuable for predicting areas of high malaria risk in highland regions. Application in areas where malaria surveillance is limited could identify households at higher risk and help focus interventions.},

abstract = {The continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide due to anthropogenic emissions is predicted to lead to significant changes in climate. About half of the current emissions are being absorbed by the ocean and by land ecosystems, but this absorption is sensitive to climate as well as to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, creating a feedback loop. General circulation models have generally excluded the feedback between climate and the biosphere, using static vegetation distributions and CO2 concentrations from simple carbon-cycle models that do not include climate change. Here we present results from a fully coupled, three-dimensional carbon-climate model, indicating that carbon-cycle feedbacks could significantly accelerate climate change over the twenty-first century. We find that under a 'business as usual' scenario, the terrestrial biosphere acts as an overall carbon sink until about 2050, but turns into a source thereafter. By 2100, the ocean uptake rate of 5 Gt C yr(-1) is balanced by the terrestrial carbon source, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations are 250 p.p.m.v. higher in our fully coupled simulation than in uncoupled carbon models, resulting in a global-mean warming of 5.5 K, as compared to 4 K without the carbon-cycle feedback.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Direct analysis of microbial communities in the environment and human body has become more convenient and reliable owing to the advancements of high-throughput sequencing techniques for 16S rRNA gene profiling. Inferring the correlation relationship among members of microbial communities is of fundamental importance for genomic survey study. Traditional Pearson correlation analysis treating the observed data as absolute abundances of the microbes may lead to spurious results because the data only represent relative abundances. Special care and appropriate methods are required prior to correlation analysis for these compositional data.

RESULTS: In this article, we first discuss the correlation definition of latent variables for compositional data. We then propose a novel method called CCLasso based on least squares with [Formula: see text] penalty to infer the correlation network for latent variables of compositional data from metagenomic data. An effective alternating direction algorithm from augmented Lagrangian method is used to solve the optimization problem. The simulation results show that CCLasso outperforms existing methods, e.g. SparCC, in edge recovery for compositional data. It also compares well with SparCC in estimating correlation network of microbe species from the Human Microbiome Project.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CCLasso is open source and freely available from https://github.com/huayingfang/CCLasso under GNU LGPL v3.

@article{Fink2010,
abstract = {The distributions of animal populations change and evolve through time. Migratory species exploit different habitats at different times of the year. Biotic and abiotic features that determine where a species lives vary due to natural and anthropogenic factors. This spatiotemporal variation needs to be accounted for in any modeling of species' distributions. In this paper we introduce a semiparametric model that provides a flexible framework for analyzing dynamic patterns of species occurrence and abundance from broad-scale survey data. The spatiotemporal exploratory model (STEM) adds essential spatiotemporal structure to existing techniques for developing species distribution models through a simple parametric structure without requiring a detailed understanding of the underlying dynamic processes. STEMs use a multi-scale strategy to differentiate between local and global-scale spatiotemporal structure. A user-specified species distribution model accounts for spatial and temporal patterning at the local level. These local patterns are then allowed to "scale up" via ensemble averaging to larger scales. This makes STEMs especially well suited for exploring distributional dynamics arising from a variety of processes. Using data from eBird, an online citizen science bird-monitoring project, we demonstrate that monthly changes in distribution of a migratory species, the Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), can be more accurately described with a STEM than a conventional bagged decision tree model in which spatiotemporal structure has not been imposed. We also demonstrate that there is no loss of model predictive power when a STEM is used to describe a spatiotemporal distribution with very little spatiotemporal variation; the distribution of a nonmigratory species, the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis).},

@article{Gerhard2004,
abstract = {The National Institutes of Health's Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) project was designed to generate and sequence a publicly accessible cDNA resource containing a complete open reading frame (ORF) for every human and mouse gene. The project initially used a random strategy to select clones from a large number of cDNA libraries from diverse tissues. Candidate clones were chosen based on 5'-EST sequences, and then fully sequenced to high accuracy and analyzed by algorithms developed for this project. Currently, more than 11,000 human and 10,000 mouse genes are represented in MGC by at least one clone with a full ORF. The random selection approach is now reaching a saturation point, and a transition to protocols targeted at the missing transcripts is now required to complete the mouse and human collections. Comparison of the sequence of the MGC clones to reference genome sequences reveals that most cDNA clones are of very high sequence quality, although it is likely that some cDNAs may carry missense variants as a consequence of experimental artifact, such as PCR, cloning, or reverse transcriptase errors. Recently, a rat cDNA component was added to the project, and ongoing frog (Xenopus) and zebrafish (Danio) cDNA projects were expanded to take advantage of the high-throughput MGC pipeline.},

@article{Goldman1964,
abstract = {This paper presents a unified account of the theory of least squares and its adaptations to statistical models more complicated than the classical one. First comes a development of the properties of weak generalized matrix inverses, a useful variant of the more familiar pseudo-inverse. These properties are employed in a proof of the usual Gauss theorem, and in analyzing the case in which known linear restraints are obeyed by the parameters. Another situation treated is that of a singular variance- covariance matrix for the observations. Applications include the case of equi-correlated variables (including estimation despite ignorance of the correlation), linear 'restraints' subject to random error, and step wise linear estimation.},

@article{Goodenough2012,
abstract = {Despite recent papers on problems associated with full-model and stepwise regression, their use is still common throughout ecological and environmental disciplines. Alternative approaches, including generating multiple models and comparing them post-hoc using techniques such as Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), are becoming more popular. However, these are problematic when there are numerous independent variables and interpretation is often difficult when competing models contain many different variables and combinations of variables. Here, we detail a new approach, REVS (Regression with Empirical Variable Selection), which uses all-subsets regression to quantify empirical support for every independent variable. A series of models is created; the first containing the variable with most empirical support, the second containing the first variable and the next most-supported, and so on. The comparatively small number of resultant models (n = the number of predictor variables) means that post-hoc comparison is comparatively quick and easy. When tested on a real dataset--habitat and offspring quality in the great tit (Parus major)--the optimal REVS model explained more variance (higher R(2)), was more parsimonious (lower AIC), and had greater significance (lower P values), than full, stepwise or all-subsets models; it also had higher predictive accuracy based on split-sample validation. Testing REVS on ten further datasets suggested that this is typical, with R(2) values being higher than full or stepwise models (mean improvement = 31{\%} and 7{\%}, respectively). Results are ecologically intuitive as even when there are several competing models, they share a set of "core" variables and differ only in presence/absence of one or two additional variables. We conclude that REVS is useful for analysing complex datasets, including those in ecology and environmental disciplines.},

@article{Grabs2009,
abstract = {Topography is often one of the major controls on the spatial pattern of saturated areas, which in turn is a key to understanding much of the variability in soils, hydrological processes, and stream water quality. The topographic wetness index (TWI) has become a widely used tool to describe wetness conditions at the catchment scale. With this index, however, it is assumed that groundwater gradients always equal surface gradients. To overcome this limitation, we suggest deriving wetness indices based on simulations of distributed catchment models. We compared these new indices with the TWI and evaluated the different indices by their capacity to predict spatial patterns of saturated areas. Results showed that the model-derived wetness indices predicted the spatial distribution of wetlands significantly better than the TWI. These results encourage the use of a dynamic distributed hydrological model to derive wetness index maps for hydrological landscape analysis in catchments with topographically driven groundwater tables.},

abstract = {In areas of stable transmission, clinical immunity to mild malaria is acquired slowly, so it is not usually effective until early adolescence. Life-threatening disease is, however, restricted to a much younger age group, indicating that resistance to the severe clinical consequences of infection is acquired more quickly. Understanding how rapidly immunity develops to severe malaria is essential, as severe malaria should be the primary target of intervention strategies, and predicting the result of interventions that reduce host exposure will require consideration of these dynamics. Severe disease in childhood is less frequent in areas where transmission is the greatest. One explanation for this is that infants experience increased exposure to infection while they are protected from disease, possibly by maternal antibody. They therefore emerge from this period of clinical protection with considerably more immunity than those who experience lower transmission intensities. Here we use this data, assuming a period of clinical protection, to estimate the number of prior infections needed to reduce the risk of severe disease to negligible levels. Contrary to expectations, one or two successful infective bites seem to be all that is necessary across a broad range of transmission intensities.},

abstract = {Geographic changes in species distributions toward traditionally cooler climes is one hypothesized indicator of recent global climate change. We examined distribution data on 56 bird species. If global warming is affecting species distributions across the temperate northern hemisphere, these data should show the same northward range expansions of birds that have been reported for Great Britain. Because a northward shift of distributions might be due to multidirectional range expansions for multiple species, we also examined the possibility that birds with northern distributions may be expanding their ranges southward. There was no southward expansion of birds with a northern distribution, indicating that there is no evidence of overall range expansion of insectivorous and granivorous birds in North America. As predicted, the northern limit of birds with a southern distribution showed a significant shift northward (2.35 km/year). This northward shift is similar to that observed in previous work conducted in Great Britain: the widespread nature of this shift in species distributions over two distinct geographical regions and its coincidence with a period of global warming suggests a connection with global climate change.},

abstract = {We consider selecting both fixed and random effects in a general class of mixed effects models using maximum penalized likelihood (MPL) estimation along with the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (ALASSO) penalty functions. The MPL estimates are shown to possess consistency and sparsity properties and asymptotic normality. A model selection criterion, called the IC(Q) statistic, is proposed for selecting the penalty parameters (Ibrahim, Zhu, and Tang, 2008, Journal of the American Statistical Association 103, 1648-1658). The variable selection procedure based on IC(Q) is shown to consistently select important fixed and random effects. The methodology is very general and can be applied to numerous situations involving random effects, including generalized linear mixed models. Simulation studies and a real data set from a Yale infant growth study are used to illustrate the proposed methodology.},

@article{Jobbagy2011,
abstract = {In arid regions throughout the world, shallow phreatic aquifers feed natural oases of much higher productivity than would be expected solely from local rainfall. In South America, the presence of well-developed Prosopis flexuosa woodlands in the Monte Desert region east of the Andes has puzzled scientists for decades. Today these woodlands provide crucial subsistence to local populations, including descendants of the indigenous Huarpes. We explore the vulnerability and importance of phreatic groundwater for the productivity of the region, comparing the contributions of local rainfall to that of remote mountain recharge that is increasingly being diverted for irrigated agriculture before it reaches the desert. We combined deep soil coring, plant measurements, direct water-table observations, and stable-isotopic analyses (2H and 18O) of meteoric, surface, and ground waters at three study sites across the region, comparing woodland stands, bare dunes, and surrounding shrublands. The isotopic composition of phreatic groundwaters (delta2H: -137 per thousand +/- 5 per thousand) closely matched the signature of water brought to the region by the Mendoza River (-137 per thousand +/- 6 per thousand), suggestin that mountain-river infiltration rather than in situ rainfall deep drainage (-39 per thousand +/- 19 per thousand) was the dominant mechanism of recharge. Similarly, chloride mass balances determined from deep soil profiles (> 6 m) suggested very low recharge rates. Vegetation in woodland ecosystems, where significant groundwater discharge losses, likely >100 mm/yr occurred, relied on regionally derived groundwater located from 6.5 to 9.5 m underground. At these locations, daily water-table fluctuations of 10 mm, and stable-isotopic measurements of plant water, indicated groundwater uptake rates of 200-300 mm/yr. Regional scaling suggests that groundwater evapotranspiration reaches 18-42 mm/yr across the landscape, accounting for 7 17{\%} of the Mendoza River flow regionally. Our study highlights the reliance of ecosystem productivity in natural oases on Andean snowmelt, which is increasingly being diverted to one of the largest irrigated regions of the continent. Understanding the ecohydrological coupling of mountain and desert ecosystems here and elsewhere should help managers balance production agriculture and conservation of unique woodland ecosystems and the rural communities that rely on them.},

abstract = {The relationship between plant nutrient content and insect herbivore populations and community structure has long interested ecologists. Insect herbivores require multiple nutrients, but ecologists have focused mostly on nitrogen (an estimate of plant protein content), and more recently phosphorus (P); other nutrients have received little attention. Here we document nutrient variation in grass and forb samples from grassland habitats in central Nebraska using an elemental approach; in total we measured foliar concentrations of 12 elements (N and P, plus S, B, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu). We detected significant variability among sites for N, P, Mg, Na, K, and Cu. We next used a model selection approach to explore how this nutritional variation and plant biomass correlate with grasshopper densities (collectively and at the feeding-guild level), and principal component analysis to explore nutrient correlations with grasshopper community species composition. When all grasshoppers were pooled, densities varied among sites, but only P was associated with abundance of the elements shown to vary between sites. Different responses occurred at the feeding-guild level. For grass specialists, densities were associated with N, plus P, Mg, and Na. For forb specialists, N and P were often associated with density, but associations with Na and K were also observed. Finally, mixed-feeder abundance was strongly associated with biomass, and to a lesser extent P, Mg, Na, and Cu. At the community level, B, Ca, Zn, and Cu, plus biomass, explained > 30{\%} of species composition variation. Our results confirm the positive association of N and P with insect herbivore populations, while suggesting a potential role for Mg, Na, and K. They also demonstrate the importance of exploring effects at the feeding-guild level. We hope our data motivate ecologists to think beyond N and P when considering plant nutrient effects on insect herbivores, and make a call for studies to examine functional responses of insect herbivores to dietary manipulation of Mg, Na, and K. Finally, our results demonstrate correlations between variation in nutrients and species assemblages, but factors not linked to plant nutrient quality or biomass likely explain most of the observed variation.},

abstract = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

abstract = {Statistical models of microbial water quality inform risk management for water recreation. Current research focuses on resource-intensive, location-specific data collection and water quality modeling, but this approach may be cost-prohibitive for risk managers responsible for numerous recreation sites. As an alternative, we tested the ability of two data-driven models, tree regression and random forests with conditional inference trees, to select readily available hydrometeorological variables for use in linear mixed effects (LME) models predicting bacterial density. The study included the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) and Lake Michigan beaches and harbors in Chicago, Illinois, at which Escherichia coli and enterococci were measured seasonally in 2007-2009. Tree regression node variables reduced data dimensionality by >50 {\%}. Variable importance ranks from random forests were used in a forward-step selection based on R (2) and root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE). We found two to three variables explained bacteria densities well relative to random forests with all variables. LME models with tree- or forest-selected variables performed reasonably well (0.335 < R (2) < 0.658). LME models for Lake Michigan had good prediction accuracy with respect to the single sample maximum standard (72-77 {\%}), but limited sensitivity (23-62 {\%}). Results suggest that our alternative approach is feasible and performs similarly to more resource-intensive approaches.},

abstract = {A previously published cross-sectional model of cognitive mediation of rape's impact on health (M. P. Koss, A. J. Figueredo, {\&} R. J. Prince, 2002) was replicated longitudinally. Rape survivors (n = 59) were assessed 4 times at 3-24 months postrape. Growth curve analysis demonstrated significant change in all mediators and outcomes. Previously reported effects of Characterological Self-Blame, Behavioral Self- Blame, and Maladaptive Beliefs on Psychosocial Distress were partially cross-validated in intercept and slope data. The results suggest that Characterological Self-Blame sets the initial level of Psychosocial Distress and that reduction in Behavioral Self-Blame drives recovery. These effects on distress were wholly mediated through self-blame's association with alterations in beliefs about self and others.},

abstract = {Motivated by research problems arising in the analysis of gut microbiome and metagenomic data, we consider variable selection and estimation in high-dimensional regression with compositional covariates. We propose an {\{}ell{\}}1 regularization method for the linear log-contrast model that respects the unique features of compositional data. We formulate the proposed procedure as a constrained convex optimization problem and introduce a coordinate descent method of multipliers for efficient computation. In the high-dimensional setting where the dimensionality grows at most exponentially with the sample size, model selection consistency and [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"> bounds for the resulting estimator are established under conditions that are mild and interpretable for compositional data. The numerical performance of our method is evaluated via simulation studies and its usefulness is illustrated by an application to a microbiome study relating human body mass index to gut microbiome composition.},

abstract = {In the life sciences, many measurement methods yield only the relative abundances of different components in a sample. With such relative-or compositional-data, differential expression needs careful interpretation, and correlation-a statistical workhorse for analyzing pairwise relationships-is an inappropriate measure of association. Using yeast gene expression data we show how correlation can be misleading and present proportionality as a valid alternative for relative data. We show how the strength of proportionality between two variables can be meaningfully and interpretably described by a new statistic ϕ which can be used instead of correlation as the basis of familiar analyses and visualisation methods, including co-expression networks and clustered heatmaps. While the main aim of this study is to present proportionality as a means to analyse relative data, it also raises intriguing questions about the molecular mechanisms underlying the proportional regulation of a range of yeast genes.},

@article{Malone2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A stochastic discrete event simulation model was developed to assess the effectiveness of passenger screening for Pandemic Influenza (PI) at U.S. airport foreign entry.

METHODS: International passengers arriving at 18 U.S. airports from Asia, Europe, South America, and Canada were assigned to one of three states: not infected, infected with PI, infected with other respiratory illness. Passengers passed through layered screening then exited the model. 80{\%} screening effectiveness was assumed for symptomatic passengers; 6{\%} asymptomatic passengers.

RESULTS: In the first 100 days of a global pandemic, U.S. airport screening would evaluate over 17 M passengers with 800 K secondary screenings. 11,570 PI infected passengers (majority asymptomatic) would enter the U.S. undetected from all 18 airports. Foreign airport departure screening significantly decreased the false negative (infected/undetected) passengers. U.S. attack rates: no screening (26.9{\%}-30.9{\%}); screening (26.4{\%}-30.6{\%}); however airport screening results in 800 K-1.8 M less U.S. PI cases; 16 K-35 K less deaths (2{\%} fatality rate). Antiviral medications for travel contact prophylaxis (10 contacts/PI passenger) were high - 8.8M. False positives from all 18 airports: 100-200/day.

CONCLUSIONS: Foreign shore exit screening greatly reduces numbers of PI infected passengers. U.S. airport screening identifies 50{\%} infected individuals; efficacy is limited by the asymptomatic PI infected. Screening will not significantly delay arrival of PI via international air transport, but will reduce the rate of new US cases and subsequent deaths.},

abstract = {Infectious diseases are still among the leading causes of death worldwide due to their persistence, emergence, and reemergence. As the recent Ebola virus disease and MERS-CoV outbreaks demonstrate, the modern epidemics and large-scale infectious outbreaks emerge and spread quickly. Air transportation is a major vehicle for the rapid spread and dissemination of communicable diseases, and there have been a number of reported outbreaks of serious airborne diseases aboard commercial flights including tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza, smallpox, and measles, to name a few. In 2014 alone, over 3.3 billion passengers (a number equivalent to 42{\%} of the world population) and 50 million metric tons of cargo traveled by air from 41,000 airports and 50,000 routes worldwide, and significant growth is anticipated, with passenger numbers expected to reach 5.9 billion by 2030. Given the increasing numbers of travelers, the risk of infectious disease transmission during air travel is a significant concern, and this chapter focuses on the current knowledge about transmission of infectious diseases in the context of both transmissions within the aircraft passenger cabin and commercial aircraft serving as vehicles of worldwide infection spread.},

abstract = {1. Neotropical migrant birds show a clear preference for stopover habitats with ample food supplies; yet, the proximate cues underlying these decisions remain unclear. 2. For insectivorous migrants, cues associated with vegetative phenology (e.g. flowering, leaf flush, and leaf loss) may reliably predict the availability of herbivorous arthropods. Here we examined whether migrants use the phenology of five tree species to choose stopover locations, and whether phenology accurately predicts food availability. 3. Using a combination of experimental and observational evidence, we show migrant populations closely track tree phenology, particularly the flowering phenology of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and preferentially forage in trees with more flowers. Furthermore, the flowering phenology of honey mesquite reliably predicts overall arthropod abundance as well as the arthropods preferred by migrants for food. 4. Together, these results suggest that honey mesquite flowering phenology is an important cue used by migrants to assess food availability quickly and reliably, while in transit during spring migration.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to alter the distribution and abundance of many species. Predictions of climate-induced population extinctions are supported by geographic range shifts that correspond to climatic warming, but few extinctions have been linked mechanistically to climate change. Here we show that extinctions of two populations of a checkerspot butterfly were hastened by increasing variability in precipitation, a phenomenon predicted by global climate models. We model checkerspot populations to show that changes in precipitation amplified population fluctuations, leading to rapid extinctions. As populations of checkerspots and other species become further isolated by habitat loss, climate change is likely to cause more extinctions, threatening both species diversity and critical ecosystem services.},

abstract = {We assess the significance of high-frequency variability of environmental parameters (sunlight, precipitation, temperature) for the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems under current and future climate. We examine the influence of hourly, daily, and monthly variance using the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 in conjunction with the long-term record of carbon fluxes measured at Harvard Forest. We find that fluctuations of sunlight and precipitation are strongly and nonlinearly coupled to ecosystem function, with effects that accumulate through annual and decadal timescales. Increasing variability in sunlight and precipitation leads to lower rates of carbon sequestration and favors broad-leaved deciduous trees over conifers. Temperature variability has only minor impacts by comparison. We also find that projected changes in sunlight and precipitation variability have important implications for carbon storage and ecosystem structure and composition. Based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change model estimates for changes in high-frequency meteorological variability over the next 100 years, we expect that terrestrial ecosystems will be affected by changes in variability almost as much as by changes in mean climate. We conclude that terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to high-frequency meteorological variability, and that accurate knowledge of the statistics of this variability is essential for realistic predictions of ecosystem structure and functioning.},

abstract = {We have mapped and quantified mouse transcriptomes by deeply sequencing them and recording how frequently each gene is represented in the sequence sample (RNA-Seq). This provides a digital measure of the presence and prevalence of transcripts from known and previously unknown genes. We report reference measurements composed of 41-52 million mapped 25-base-pair reads for poly(A)-selected RNA from adult mouse brain, liver and skeletal muscle tissues. We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although >90{\%} of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. We observed 1.45 x 10(5) distinct splices, and alternative splices were prominent, with 3,500 different genes expressing one or more alternate internal splices.},

By controlling the presence of two bird species, great tits (Parus major; foliage gleaner) and nuthatches (Sitta europaea; trunk gleaner), in the enclosures, their effect on predatory insects (ants), herbivorous insects (Lepidoptera larvae) and producers (oak trees) was quantified. Great tits reduced the density of Lepidoptera larvae and, indirectly, leaf damage, but had no impact on ants. Nuthatches decreased the density of ants but did not influence either Lepidoptera larvae or leaf damage. These results highlight species-specific functions of birds in the maintenance of forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {The benchmark dose (BMD) approach is being increasingly used in the area of food risk assessment because it offers several advantages compared to the conventional no-observed-adverse-effect-level approach. The aim of this work was to check the applicability of the BMD approach on toxicity data available from pesticides, mycotoxins and natural toxins. Based on toxicological evaluations, the pivotal study was identified. Detailed data from the original study were retrieved and used for BMD modelling. Twenty-five studies used for BMD modelling were analysed with regard to study design: total number of animals, number of dose levels, and spacing between dose levels. The quality of the modelled endpoints was evaluated according to the following aspects: BMD/BMDL ratio, test for goodness of fit and BMD in the range of dose levels. If one of these aspects was not fulfilled, the BMD derived from this endpoint was considered to be uncertain to some extent and corresponding modelled data sets were examined. The present work demonstrates that the BMD approach is in principle applicable to pesticides, mycotoxins, and natural toxins. Although large differences relating to data availability and data quality were noticed, 69 of 82 modelled endpoints (84{\%}) fulfilled the three quality aspects of BMD modelling.},

abstract = {Fence method (Jiang and others 2008. Fence methods for mixed model selection. Annals of Statistics 36, 1669-1692) is a recently proposed strategy for model selection. It was motivated by the limitation of the traditional information criteria in selecting parsimonious models in some nonconventional situations, such as mixed model selection. Jiang and others (2009. A simplified adaptive fence procedure, Statistics {\&} Probability Letters 79, 625-629) simplified the adaptive fence method of Jiang and others (2008) to make it more suitable and convenient to use in a wide variety of problems. Still, the current modification encounters computational difficulties when applied to high-dimensional and complex problems. To address this concern, we proposed a restricted fence procedure that combines the idea of the fence with that of the restricted maximum likelihood. Furthermore, we propose to use the wild bootstrap for choosing adaptively the tuning parameter used in the restricted fence. We focus on problems of longitudinal studies and demonstrate the performance of the new procedure and its comparison with other procedures of variable selection, including the information criteria and shrinkage methods, in simulation studies. The method is further illustrated by an example of real-data analysis.},

abstract = {Within the special geometry of the simplex, the sample space of compositional data, compositional orthonormal coordinates allow the application of any multivariate statistical approach. The search for meaningful coordinates has suggested balances (between two groups of parts)—based on a sequential binary partition of a D-part composition—and a representation in form of a CoDa-dendrogram. Projected samples are represented in a dendrogram-like graph showing: (a) the way of grouping parts; (b) the explanatory role of subcompositions generated in the partition process; (c) the decomposition of the variance; (d) the center and quantiles of each balance. The representation is useful for the interpretation of balances and to describe the sample in a single diagram independently of the number of parts. Also, samples of two or more populations, as well as several samples from the same population, can be represented in the same graph, as long as they have the same parts registered. The approach is illustrated with an example of food consumption in Europe},

abstract = {Terrain attributes derived from digital elevation models have been used widely for mapping soil organic matter (SOM). Among these attributes, the topographic wetness index (TWI), an index for quantitatively indicating the balance between water accumulation and drainage conditions at the local scale, has been shown to correlate with SOM. However, TWIs used in most studies are calculated using a single-flow-direction (SFD) algorithm, which assumes that all water from a grid cell flows into only one neighboring cell. This assumption is not always valid, especially in areas with low relief where movement of water may be divergent. To overcome this SFD limitation, a multiple-flow-direction (MFD) algorithm has been developed, which distributes flow from a grid cell to several downslope neighbors. In this study we compared the effect of TWI calculations based on SFD and MFD in predictive mapping of SOM by incorporating them into different kriging methods over a 51.76km2 area in Nenjiang County of northeastern China. We found that the MFD-based TWI was better correlated with SOM than was the SFD-based index. We then compared the accuracies of SOM maps which were derived from MFD-based TWI and SFD-based TWI incorporated by ordinary kriging (OK), simple kriging with varying local means (SKlm), kriging with external drift (KED) and collocated cokriging (CC). The MFD-based TWI, used as a secondary variable in SKlm and CC, outperforms the SFD-based TWI. For the different kriging methods, CC (incorporating either MFD-based TWI or SFD-based TWI) showed the best performance, and OK generated a better result than SKlm and KED. Both the MFD-based TWI and SFD-based TWI proved to be incompatible with KED and SKlm due to their numerical instability caused by the rough TWI surfaces. Among all predictive methods, CC incorporating the MFD-based TWI produced the best results. This is because: (1) the MFD-based TWI is best able to indicate quantitatively soil moisture and therefore has the strongest correlation with SOM; (2) CC is capable of utilizing effectively the spatial auto-correlation of SOM and the cross-correlation between SOM and the MFD-based TWI.},

abstract = {Seabird populations of the Southern Ocean have been responding to climate change for the last three decades and demographic models suggest that projected warming will cause dramatic population changes over the next century. Shift in species distribution is likely to be one of the major possible adaptations to changing environmental conditions. Habitat models based on a unique long-term tracking dataset of king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) breeding on the Crozet Islands (southern Indian Ocean) revealed that despite a significant influence of primary productivity and mesoscale activity, sea surface temperature consistently drove penguins' foraging distribution. According to climate models of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the projected warming of surface waters would lead to a gradual southward shift of the more profitable foraging zones, ranging from 25 km per decade for the B1 IPCC scenario to 40 km per decade for the A1B and A2 scenarios. As a consequence, distances travelled by incubating and brooding birds to reach optimal foraging zones associated with the polar front would double by 2100. Such a shift is far beyond the usual foraging range of king penguins breeding and would negatively affect the Crozet population on the long term, unless penguins develop alternative foraging strategies.},

abstract = {Some islands in the Gulf of California support very high densities of spiders. Spider density is negatively correlated with island size; many small islands support 50-200 spiders per m3 of cactus. Energy for these spiders comes primarily from the ocean and not from in situ productivity by land plants. We explicitly connect the marine and terrestrial systems to show that insular food webs represent one endpoint of the marine web. We describe two conduits for marine energy entering these islands: shore drift and seabird colonies. Both conduits are related to island area, having a much stronger effect on smaller islands. This asymmetric effect helps to explain the exceptionally high spider densities on small islands. Although productivity sets the maximal potential densities, predation (by scorpions) limits realized spider abundance. Thus, prey availability and predation act in concert to set insular spider abundance.},

abstract = {Changes in climate during the 20th century differ from region to region across the United States. We provide strong evidence that spatial variations in US temperature trends are linked to the hydrologic cycle, and we also present unique information on the seasonal and latitudinal structure of the linkage. We show that there is a statistically significant inverse relationship between trends in daily temperature and average daily precipitation across regions. This linkage is most pronounced in the southern United States (30-40 degrees N) during the May-June time period and, to a lesser extent, in the northern United States (40-50 degrees N) during the July-August time period. It is strongest in trends in maximum temperatures (T(max)) and 90th percentile exceedance trends (90PET), and less pronounced in the T(max) 10PET and the corresponding T(min) statistics, and it is robust to changes in analysis period. Although previous studies suggest that areas of increased precipitation may have reduced trends in temperature compared with drier regions, a change in sign from positive to negative trends suggests some additional cause. We show that trends in precipitation may account for some, but not likely all, of the cause point to evidence that shows that dynamical patterns (El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, etc.) cannot account for the observed effects during May-June. We speculate that changing aerosols, perhaps related to vegetation changes, and increased strength of the aerosol direct and indirect effect may play a role in the observed linkages between these indices of temperature change and the hydrologic cycle.},

abstract = {The ideal chemopreventive agent targets pre-neoplastic changes and intraepithelial neoplasia, preventing progression over time without notable side effects. Assessment of success of chemopreventive intervention in the short and medium term remains a challenge, and in this review the suggestion is investigated that karyometric measurements constitute suitable markers of chemopreventive efficacy. Karyometry provides the sensitivity required to detect small differences amidst relatively high biological variability. It can help establish progression curves of intraepithelial neoplasia (IEN) to invasive cancer, and thus detect chemopreventive effects. Such effects can be observed in two ways, at the group level (intervention vs. placebo), and at the case (or patient) level. The latter is more difficult to establish, necessitating the development of specialised statistical methods. Analysis of between-case and within-case heterogeneity can reveal useful information about cancer progression and prevention. We suggest that karyometry can objectively quantify IEN progression, providing a framework for statistically securing chemopreventive effects. It can act as an integrating biomarker by detecting chemopreventive activity even when the mechanism for a given progression pathway is unknown, or when multiple pathways exist. The sensitivity of karyometric detection can help optimise the design of clinical trials of novel chemopreventive agents by decreasing trial duration and/or sample size.},

abstract = {A large number of computational methods have been developed for analyzing differential gene expression in RNA-seq data. We describe a comprehensive evaluation of common methods using the SEQC benchmark dataset and ENCODE data. We consider a number of key features, including normalization, accuracy of differential expression detection and differential expression analysis when one condition has no detectable expression. We find significant differences among the methods, but note that array-based methods adapted to RNA-seq data perform comparably to methods designed for RNA-seq. Our results demonstrate that increasing the number of replicate samples significantly improves detection power over increased sequencing depth.},

@article{Rodhe1999,
abstract = {Information about the spatial distributions of soil moisture or groundwater levels is needed for aggregation of soil–vegetation–atmosphere–transfer (SVAT) models. The possibility of predicting wetness distributions in catchments from topographic data was investigated using topographic indices, notably the TOPMODEL index. The indices were calculated from commercially available gridded data (50×50m2) over two areas with contrasting topography: a catchment (N{\aa}sten) in the low-relief NOPEX region in southern Sweden and a group of catchments in a hilly area (Kassj{\"{o}}{\aa}n) in central Sweden. The occurrence of mires, assumed to represent the extreme wetness end of the wetness spectrum, was used as field data. The frequency distributions of topographic indices for mire and non-mires were clearly different in Kassj{\"{o}}{\aa}n, although there was a large overlapping, whereas the two distributions were very similar in N{\aa}sten. Prediction of mires from topographic indices was meaningful only in Kassj{\"{o}}{\aa}n. Although it gave poor results in terms of fractions of successfully predicted mire cells out of the observed mire cells, the general spatial patterns of mires were fairly well simulated. One important reason for the failure of the indices to predict mires in N{\aa}sten, and probably also to predict other wetness classes, is that the spatial resolution in the index calculation was coarser than typical length scales of the topographic features in this catchment, being only a few tenths of meters. The importance of geologic conditions in modifying the topographic control over the wetness is exemplified from the obtained relationship between topographic indices and mire occurrence.},

abstract = {Ichthyoplankton surveys were conducted in surface waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGoM) over a three-year period (2006-2008) to determine the relative value of this region as early life habitat of sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus), blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), white marlin (Kajikia albida), and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Sailfish were the dominant billfish collected in summer surveys, and larvae were present at 37.5{\%} of the stations sampled. Blue marlin and white marlin larvae were present at 25.0{\%} and 4.6{\%} of the stations sampled, respectively, while swordfish occurred at 17.2{\%} of the stations. Areas of peak production were detected and maximum density estimates for sailfish (22.09 larvae 1000 m(-2)) were significantly higher than the three other species: blue marlin (9.62 larvae 1000 m(-2)), white marlin (5.44 larvae 1000 m(-2)), and swordfish (4.67 larvae 1000 m(-2)). The distribution and abundance of billfish and swordfish larvae varied spatially and temporally, and several environmental variables (sea surface temperature, salinity, sea surface height, distance to the Loop Current, current velocity, water depth, and Sargassum biomass) were deemed to be influential variables in generalized additive models (GAMs). Mesoscale features in the NGoM affected the distribution and abundance of billfish and swordfish larvae, with densities typically higher in frontal zones or areas proximal to the Loop Current. Habitat suitability of all four species was strongly linked to physicochemical attributes of the water masses they inhabited, and observed abundance was higher in slope waters with lower sea surface temperature and higher salinity. Our results highlight the value of the NGoM as early life habitat of billfishes and swordfish, and represent valuable baseline data for evaluating anthropogenic effects (i.e., Deepwater Horizon oil spill) on the Atlantic billfish and swordfish populations.},

Ecological studies attribute plant and animal changes to observed warming. Until now, temperature-species connections have not been statistically attributed directly to anthropogenic climatic change. Using modeled climatic variables and observed species data, which are independent of thermometer records and paleoclimatic proxies, we demonstrate statistically significant "joint attribution," a two-step linkage: human activities contribute significantly to temperature changes and human-changed temperatures are associated with discernible changes in plant and animal traits. Additionally, our analyses provide independent testing of grid-box-scale temperature projections from a general circulation model (HadCM3).},

The World Health Organization defines malaria as a disease of poverty caused by poverty. Pregnant women infected with malaria usually have more severe symptoms and outcomes, with higher rates of miscarriage, intrauterine demise, premature delivery, low-birth-weight neonates, and neonatal death. They are also at a higher risk for severe anemia and maternal death. Malaria can be prevented with appropriate drugs, bed nets treated with insecticide, and effective educational outreach programs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The integrity of RNA molecules is of paramount importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of gene expression at the moment of RNA extraction. Until recently, there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity of RNA samples and the ratio of 28S:18S ribosomal RNA, the common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be inconsistent. The advent of microcapillary electrophoretic RNA separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput approach, in order to estimate the integrity of RNA samples in an unambiguous way.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A method is introduced that automatically selects features from signal measurements and constructs regression models based on a Bayesian learning technique. Feature spaces of different dimensionality are compared in the Bayesian framework, which allows selecting a final feature combination corresponding to models with high posterior probability.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: This approach is applied to a large collection of electrophoretic RNA measurements recorded with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that describes RNA integrity. The resulting algorithm is a user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for standardization of RNA quality control that allows the calculation of an RNA integrity number (RIN).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our results show the importance of taking characteristics of several regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order to get a robust and reliable prediction of RNA integrity, especially if compared to traditional methods.},

A total of 81 patients were recruited to the study: 16 men (19.8{\%}) and 65 women (80.2{\%}). Of these, 62 patients (10 men, 52 women) with a mean age of 73 (57 to 83) underwent static and dynamic assessment of balance pre-operatively and one year post-operatively. The parameters of balance were quantified using commercially available and validated equipment. Motor function and self-reported outcome were also assessed. There was a significant improvement in dynamic balance (p < 0.001) one year after TKR, and better balance correlated with improved mobility, functional balance and increased health-related quality of life. As it seems that balance, and not only pain relief, influences the success of TKR, balance skills should be better addressed during the post-operative rehabilitation of patients who undergo TKR.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Air carrier and professional corporate aircrews provide a unique and highly distinct population in which to examine potential transport and transmission of infectious diseases (ID). This study sought to assess frequency of flying while acutely ill, identify clinical triggers in self-grounding, determine employer support for self-grounding, examine rates of influenza vaccination, and identify unmet needs for current information on ID issues related to extensive travel required of professional aircrews.

METHODS: Anonymous questionnaires were completed by select European mainline, U.S. regional airline, and professional corporate aircrews on ID topics such as flying while ill, flying with ill crewmembers, receipt of influenza vaccination, disinfection, and other aviation medical issues. Data were analyzed and reported as composite and stratified by airline vs. corporate aviation respondents.

RESULTS: Aircrews often flew while ill (or with ill crewmembers); 52{\%} flew until fever reached 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) and an additional 37{\%} flew up to 38.89 degrees C (102 degrees F). Rate of annual influenza vaccination was quite low for all groups, but especially so for airline crews (21-27{\%}), even given potential occupational exposure risk. Crews also had strongly differing perceptions of employer views on self-grounding, depending upon employment setting.

CONCLUSIONS: There were sizable disparities between aircrew flying for U.S. regional, European mainline, and large corporate aviation departments with respect to self-grounding when ill and routinely receiving a seasonal influenza vaccination. All study groups reported a pressing need for enhanced anonymous access to current ID and medical information.},

abstract = {The ability to measure vegetation structure at spatial scales that are biologically meaningful for wildlife is often limited because information about the spatial scale of habitat selection is lacking and there are logistical constraints to measuring vegetation structure at ever larger spatial scales. To address this challenge, we used LiDAR-derived measurements of vegetation canopy height to quantify habitat associations of riparian birds at the Cosumnes River Preserve in central California, USA. Our objectives were (1) to evaluate the utility of LiDAR (light detection and ranging) measurements for describing habitat associations of riparian passerine birds, and (2) to capitalize on the ease with which LiDAR measurements can be summarized at multiple spatial scales to evaluate the predictive performance of vegetation measurements across spatial scales from 0.2 to 50 ha. At each location where we conducted point-count surveys of the avian community, we summarized the mean and coefficient of variation of canopy height measured at five spatial scales (0.2, 0.8, 3.1, 12.6, and 50.2 ha). For each of these spatial scales, we used stepwise model selection to identify the best logistic-regression model describing patterns of occurrence for 16 species of passerine birds that were sufficiently abundant for analysis. We then used area-under-the-curve (AUC) values to identify models that performed well (AUC > 0.75) on a temporally independent data set. Of the 16 species, 10 species had logistic-regression models with AUC values > 0.75. For six of these species, AUC values were highest for the models with vegetation measurements at the 0.2-3 ha scale. For the other four species, AUC values were highest for the model with vegetation variables measured at the 50-ha scale. These results illustrate the utility of using LiDAR-derived measurements of vegetation to understand habitat associations of riparian birds and underscore the importance of using multiscale approaches to modeling wildlife habitat use.},

abstract = {Limitations imposed on species ranges by the climatic, ecological, and physiological effects of elevation are important determinants of extinction risk. We modeled the effects of elevational limits on the extinction risk of landbirds, 87{\%} of all bird species. Elevational limitation of range size explained 97{\%} of the variation in the probability of being in a World Conservation Union category of extinction risk. Our model that combined elevational ranges, four Millennium Assessment habitat-loss scenarios, and an intermediate estimate of surface warming of 2.8 degrees C, projected a best guess of 400-550 landbird extinctions, and that approximately 2150 additional species would be at risk of extinction by 2100. For Western Hemisphere landbirds, intermediate extinction estimates based on climate-induced changes in actual distributions ranged from 1.3{\%} (1.1 degrees C warming) to 30.0{\%} (6.4 degrees C warming) of these species. Worldwide, every degree of warming projected a nonlinear increase in bird extinctions of about 100-500 species. Only 21{\%} of the species predicted to become extinct in our scenarios are currently considered threatened with extinction. Different habitat-loss and surface-warming scenarios predicted substantially different futures for landbird species. To improve the precision of climate-induced extinction estimates, there is an urgent need for high-resolution measurements of shifts in the elevational ranges of species. Given the accelerating influence of climate change on species distributions and conservation, using elevational limits in a tested, standardized, and robust manner can improve conservation assessments of terrestrial species and will help identify species that are most vulnerable to global climate change. Our climate-induced extinction estimates are broadly similar to those of bird species at risk from other factors, but these estimates largely involve different sets of species.},

abstract = {The contribution of malaria to morbidity and mortality among people in Africa has been a subject of academic interest, political advocacy, and speculation. National statistics for much of sub-Saharan Africa have proved to be an unreliable source of disease-specific morbidity and mortality data. Credible estimates of disease-specific burdens are required for setting global and national priorities for health in order to rationalize the use of limited resources and lobby for financial support. We have taken an empirical approach to defining the limits of Plasmodium falciparum transmission across the continent and interpolated the distributions of projected populations in 1995. By combining a review of the literature on malaria in Africa and models of acquired functional immunity, we have estimated the age-structured rates of the fatal, morbid and disabling sequelae following exposure to malaria infection under different epidemiological conditions.

This research seeks to estimate mortality, morbidity, and disability due to malaria among Africa's nonpregnant population. It uses an empirical approach to define Plasmodium falciparum transmission limits across the continent. And, the distributions of projected populations in 1995 are interjected. The review of literature on malaria in Africa and models of acquired functional immunity served as a basis for the researchers to predict the age-structured rates of the fatal, morbid and disabling consequences following malaria infection. These estimates were tabulated and analyzed. The results indicated that among populations exposed to stable endemic malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 987,466 people might have died in 1995 due to malaria infection. On the other hand, over 207.5 million clinical attacks of malaria may have occurred.},

This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

@article{Solomon2009,
abstract = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the "dust bowl" era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4-1.0 m if 21st century CO(2) concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6-1.9 m for peak CO(2) concentrations exceeding approximately 1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.},

Next a review is given, mostly avoiding technicalities, of the somewhat messy theory of the subject. Two approaches are distinguished: the estimation approach (controlled calibration) and the prediction approach (natural calibration). Among problems discussed are the choice of estimator, the choice of confidence region, methodology for handling situations with more variables than observations, near-collinearities (,vith countermeasures like ridge type regression, principal components regression, partial least squares regression and continuum regression), pretreatment of data, and cross-validation vs true prediction. Examples discussed in detail concern estimation of the age of a rhinoceros from its horn lengths (low-dimensional), and nitrate prediction in waste-water from high-dimensional spectroscopic measurements.},

abstract = {Infectious particles can be deposited on surfaces. Susceptible persons who contacted these contaminated surfaces may transfer the pathogens to their mucous membranes via hands, leading to a risk of respiratory infection. The exposure and infection risk contributed by this transmission route depend on indoor surface material, ventilation, and human behavior. In this study, quantitative infection risk assessments were used to compare the significances of these factors. The risks of three pathogens, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus, in an aircraft cabin and in a hospital ward were assessed. Results showed that reducing the contact rate is relatively more effective than increasing the ventilation rate to lower the infection risk. Nonfabric surface materials were found to be much more favorable in the indirect contact transmission for RSV and rhinovirus than fabric surface materials. In the cases considered in this study, halving the ventilation rate and doubling the hand contact rate to surfaces and the hand contact rate to mucous membranes would increase the risk by 3.7-16.2{\%}, 34.4-94.2{\%}, and 24.1-117.7{\%}, respectively. Contacting contaminated nonfabric surfaces may pose an indirect contact risk up to three orders of magnitude higher than that of contacting contaminated fabric surfaces. These findings provide more consideration for infection control and building environmental design.},

abstract = {Multiple commercial microarrays for measuring genome-wide gene expression levels are currently available, including oligonucleotide and cDNA, single- and two-channel formats. This study reports on the results of gene expression measurements generated from identical RNA preparations that were obtained using three commercially available microarray platforms. RNA was collected from PANC-1 cells grown in serum-rich medium and at 24 h following the removal of serum. Three biological replicates were prepared for each condition, and three experimental replicates were produced for the first biological replicate. RNA was labeled and hybridized to microarrays from three major suppliers according to manufacturers' protocols, and gene expression measurements were obtained using each platform's standard software. For each platform, gene targets from a subset of 2009 common genes were compared. Correlations in gene expression levels and comparisons for significant gene expression changes in this subset were calculated, and showed considerable divergence across the different platforms, suggesting the need for establishing industrial manufacturing standards, and further independent and thorough validation of the technology.},

abstract = {In order to clarify how vegetation types change along the environmental gradients in a cool temperate to sub-alpine mountainous zone and the determinant factors that define plant species richness, we established 360 plots (each 4 × 10 m) within which the vegetation type, species richness, elevation, topographic position index (TPI), slope inclination, and ground light index (GLI) of the natural vegetation were surveyed. Mean elevation, TPI, slope inclination, and GLI differed across vegetation types. Tree species richness was negatively correlated with elevation, whereas fern and herb species richness were positively correlated. Tree species richness was greater in the upper slope area than the lower slope area, whereas fern and herb species richness were greater in the lower slope area. Ferns and trees species richness were smaller in the open canopy, whereas herb species richness was greater in the open canopy. Vegetation types were determined firstly by elevation and secondary by topographic configurations, such as topographic position, and slope inclination. Elevation and topography were the most important factors affecting plant richness, but the most influential variables differed among plant life-form groups. Moreover, the species richness responses to these environmental gradients greatly differed among ferns, herbs, and trees.},

Experimental tests of whether bird predation on arthropods can reduce plant damage, however, are few and restricted to relatively low-diversity systems. Here, we describe an experimental test in a diverse tropical forest of whether birds indirectly defend foliage from arthropod herbivores. We also compare how the indirect effects of bird predation vary with different levels of foliage productivity in the canopy vs. the understory. For three Neotropical tree species, we observed that birds decreased local arthropod densities on canopy branches and reduced consequent damage to leaves. In contrast, we observed no evidence of bird-arthropod limitation on conspecific saplings in the less productive understory of the same forest. Our results support theory that predicts trophic cascades where productivity is high and suggest that birds play an important role in Neotropical communities by means of their indirect defense of some canopy tree species.},

@article{Wagner2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clearly air travel, by transporting infectious individuals from one geographic location to another, significantly affects the rate of spread of influenza A (H1N1). However, the possibility of within-flight transmission of H1N1 has not been evaluated; although it is known that smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, SARS and seasonal influenza can be transmitted during commercial flights. Here we present the first quantitative risk assessment to assess the potential for within-flight transmission of H1N1.

METHODS: We model airborne transmission of infectious viral particles of H1N1 within a Boeing 747 using methodology from the field of quantitative microbial risk assessment.

RESULTS: The risk of catching H1N1 will essentially be confined to passengers travelling in the same cabin as the source case. Not surprisingly, we find that the longer the flight the greater the number of infections that can be expected. We calculate that H1N1, even during long flights, poses a low to moderate within-flight transmission risk if the source case travels First Class. Specifically, 0-1 infections could occur during a 5 hour flight, 1-3 during an 11 hour flight and 2-5 during a 17 hour flight. However, within-flight transmission could be significant, particularly during long flights, if the source case travels in Economy Class. Specifically, two to five infections could occur during a 5 hour flight, 5-10 during an 11 hour flight and 7-17 during a 17 hour flight. If the aircraft is only partially loaded, under certain conditions more infections could occur in First Class than in Economy Class. During a 17 hour flight, a greater number of infections would occur in First Class than in Economy if the First Class Cabin is fully occupied, but Economy class is less than 30{\%} full.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide insights into the potential utility of air travel restrictions on controlling influenza pandemics in the winter of 2009/2010. They show travel by one infectious individual, rather than causing a single outbreak of H1N1, could cause several simultaneous outbreaks. These results imply that, during a pandemic, quarantining passengers who travel in Economy on long-haul flights could potentially be an important control strategy. Notably, our results show that quarantining passengers who travel First Class would be unlikely to be an effective control strategy.},

abstract = {We propose a computationally intensive method, the random lasso method, for variable selection in linear models. The method consists of two major steps. In step 1, the lasso method is applied to many bootstrap samples, each using a set of randomly selected covariates. A measure of importance is yielded from this step for each covariate. In step 2, a similar procedure to the first step is implemented with the exception that for each bootstrap sample, a subset of covariates is randomly selected with unequal selection probabilities determined by the covariates' importance. Adaptive lasso may be used in the second step with weights determined by the importance measures. The final set of covariates and their coefficients are determined by averaging bootstrap results obtained from step 2. The proposed method alleviates some of the limitations of lasso, elastic-net and related methods noted especially in the context of microarray data analysis: it tends to remove highly correlated variables altogether or select them all, and maintains maximal flexibility in estimating their coefficients, particularly with different signs; the number of selected variables is no longer limited by the sample size; and the resulting prediction accuracy is competitive or superior compared to the alternatives. We illustrate the proposed method by extensive simulation studies. The proposed method is also applied to a Glioblastoma microarray data analysis.},

abstract = {1. The biases and shortcomings of stepwise multiple regression are well established within the statistical literature. However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57{\%} of studies used a stepwise procedure. 2. The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issues with examples. 3. We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from each year's data. In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set. 4. An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.},

@article{Wingfield1992,
abstract = {Many avian species of the North American Sonoran desert, e.g., the black-throated sparrow, Amphispiza bilineata, cactus wren, Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus, and curve-billed thrasher, Toxostoma curvirostre, can potentially breed from March/April to August. It is possible that, at least in summer, intense heat and aridity may have inhibitory effects on breeding by precipitating a stress response. Stress typically results in a rise in secretion of adrenocorticosteroid hormones that then inhibit reproduction by suppressing release of gonadal hormones. However, we found that plasma levels of corticosterone were not higher during summer, compared with winter, even in 1989 when summer temperatures were higher than normal. In June 1990, temperatures were also above normal and soared to the highest level recorded in Arizona (50 degrees C). Plasma levels of corticosterone during June were high in black-throated sparrows, but less so in two other species (Abert's towhee, Pipilo aberti, and Inca dove, Scardafella inca) found in more shady riparian and suburban habitat with constant access to water. The adrenocortical response to stress (as measured by the rate of corticosterone increase following capture) was reduced in the hottest summer months in black-throated sparrows, cactus wrens, and curve-billed thrashers, but less so in Abert's towhee an Inca dove. These data suggest that at least some birds breeding in the open desert with restricted access to water are able to suppress the classical adrenocortical response to stress. The response is then reactivated in winter after breeding has ceased. It is possible that this stress modulation may allow breeding to continue despite severe heat. Analysis of plasma from these species indicated that the apparent modulation of the adrenocortical response to stress was not an artifact of reduced affinity or capacity of corticosterone binding proteins.},

abstract = {Changes in human microbiome are associated with many human diseases. Next generation sequencing technologies make it possible to quantify the microbial composition without the need for laboratory cultivation. One important problem of microbiome data analysis is to identify the environmental/biological covariates that are associated with different bacterial taxa. Taxa count data in microbiome studies are often over-dispersed and include many zeros. To account for such an over-dispersion, we propose to use an additive logistic normal multinomial regression model to associate the covariates to bacterial composition. The model can naturally account for sampling variabilities and zero observations and also allow for a flexible covariance structure among the bacterial taxa. In order to select the relevant covariates and to estimate the corresponding regression coefficients, we propose a group ℓ1 penalized likelihood estimation method for variable selection and estimation. We develop a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm to implement the penalized likelihood estimation. Our simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the group ℓ1 penalized multinomial logistic regression and the Dirichlet multinomial regression models in variable selection. We demonstrate the methods using a data set that links human gut microbiome to micro-nutrients in order to identify the nutrients that are associated with the human gut microbiome enterotype.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA-seq experiments produce digital counts of reads that are affected by both biological and technical variation. To distinguish the systematic changes in expression between conditions from noise, the counts are frequently modeled by the Negative Binomial distribution. However, in experiments with small sample size, the per-gene estimates of the dispersion parameter are unreliable. Method: We propose a simple and effective approach for estimating the dispersions. First, we obtain the initial estimates for each gene using the method of moments. Second, the estimates are regularized, i.e. shrunk towards a common value that minimizes the average squared difference between the initial estimates and the shrinkage estimates. The approach does not require extra modeling assumptions, is easy to compute and is compatible with the exact test of differential expression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We evaluated the proposed approach using 10 simulated and experimental datasets and compared its performance with that of currently popular packages edgeR, DESeq, baySeq, BBSeq and SAMseq.
